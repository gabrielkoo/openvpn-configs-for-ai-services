# openvpn-configs-for-ai-services

This repository provides sample OpenVPN configuration files designed to facilitate access to AI services such as **Apple Intelligence** and **OpenAI** from *regions where these services are not restricted*, with OpenVPN configuration profiles utilizing Include Tunneling. These configuration files can help users securely connect and access AI resources through **split tunneling**.

You may wonder - *I could have just used a normal OpenVPN config profile, why bother include tunneling?* If you are turning on a always-on VPN just for the sake of securely connecting to AI resources via *an unrestricted region*, it might slow down your entire web browsing experience as a whole, also it might affect your access to security-aware services like e-banking or your company resources, which are sensitive to VPN IP addresses. If you are using a split tunnel instead, you are only routing the traffic to the VPN only when it connects to the AI service - this essentially reduces the traffic load on your VPN server, and minimizes the interruption to your other normal browsing activities.

**Disclaimer**: The use of these configuration files is at your own risk. This repository is intended only for users whose home country is **permitted** to access these AI services. The author takes no responsibility for any misuse or legal implications that may arise from the use of these files.
